Design learnings: Write a reflection (~1–2k words, with images) sharing your design learnings with your community of users. 
Describe what you learned about user needs, share particular anecdotes you found really motivating, crystallize what is wrong with current designs, and document the lessons you 
learned through iterative design about what makes an effective interface for the problem you’re addressing. Detail is going to be necessary for your reflection to be convincing. 
Your write up should include at least some quotes, anecdotes, images, and/or screenshots—whatever you think helps you convey your learnings in a clear way. Your write-up might 
look a bit like what you see in this written reflection (though yours will be briefer and represent more of a synthesis than a complete listing of all collected data).
